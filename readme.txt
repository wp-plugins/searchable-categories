== Description ==

This plugin will make it quick and easy for your writers to select categories related to what they are writing.  As they type in the search box, categories will be shown and hidden in real time, allowing them to easily select what is relevant to their content without having to scroll through possibly hundreds of categories.

== Screenshots ==

1. Categories meta box with an empty search box

2. Categories meta box while searching, showing all that match and hiding everything else

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Changelog ==

v 0.2 - Updated to show subcategories of search results as well.
